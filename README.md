# BIOS735-GROUP1: Heart Attack Prediction in the United States
Our group members include Ambroise Rachelle, Davis Teya, Qaqish, Ameer, Shilin Yu, and Jingying Wang.

This project explores heart attack prediction using a dataset of 372,974 patients in the U.S., incorporating clinical, lifestyle, and demographic factors. Our goals are to develop a probabilistic model to estimate heart attack risk, implement the EM algorithm for parameter refinement, and compare predictive performance against machine learning methods like Random Forest.

We address missing data using Probabilistic PCA (PPCA), leveraging the EM algorithm for imputation. We evaluate PPCAâ€™s effectiveness by introducing controlled missingness in covariates and training a logistic regression model on low-dimensional projections. Performance comparisons will be made against alternative missing-data handling approaches.

Our analysis includes:

Logistic regression modeling based on clinical risk estimation principles
Implementation of the EM algorithm for latent variable modeling and parameter estimation
Comparison of prediction accuracy between ML methods and traditional statistical models
Development of a risk assessment tool to estimate a patient's probability of experiencing a heart attack
This work aligns with established cardiology risk estimators and aims to enhance personalized risk assessment for clinical decision-making.
